# DKCS
My latest Scratch game, Donkey Kong Country Screturns, in its purest form.

The bulk of the repository is DKCS unzipped, which can be achieved by changing the file extension to a .zip file. You can modify the JSON to add some hacked blocks or just zip it back up to a .sb2 file.

As for licensing, just treat it like a Scratch project. You can use the code freely as long as you credit me.
