# DKCS
My latest Scratch game, Donkey Kong Country Screturns, in its purest form.

The bulk of the repository is DKCS converted to a .zip file, which can be achieved by simply changing the file extension. You can modify the JSON to add some hacked blocks or just zip it back up to a .sb2 file.

As for licensing, just treat it like a Scratch project. You can use the code freely as long as you credit me.

(This is version 0.2.0 btw)
